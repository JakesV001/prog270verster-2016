<h1>My Final Webpage!</h1>
<p>My final page will contain a list of things I have learned this quarter and how much I enjoyed this class</p>

Here is my <span class="label label-success">List</span>:
- I learned about ssh, private, and public keys
- I learned how to use the Linux bash shell
- I learned how to run simple scrips and download programs
- I learned about browser security
- I learned how to deploy HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to an Apache Web Server
- I learned how to build a repository
- I learned how to deploy CGI scrips

<p>This was how I started to create and load my SSH Private and Public Key</p>
 <PRE>
 ssh-keygen -t rsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
 </PRE>

<h3>GIT</h3>
<p> Here I learned to set up my repository on GitHub.com where I could push all my work up
and retrieve it anywhere I go to pick up right where I left off. Later on I learned to pull
my work down onto my EC2 instance that I created</p>

<pre>
-git add **markdown file**
-git commit -m "My Commit"
-git push
</pre>
