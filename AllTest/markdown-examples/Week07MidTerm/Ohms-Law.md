# Ohms Law

##### [Home Page](/Week07MidTerm/Home.html)

Ohms law is the main law in pyhsics that a vaporizer/vape revolves around. Thinking basicaly, a battery puts out a certain amount of amps(current). Now that current is being pushed through there will always be a certain amount of resistance depending on what the current is running through. Once you know current and resistence, multiply them together to get the volts. The equations for ohms law is V=IR.

So when it comes to a vape, ohms law comes into play when the battery of the vape is activated and pushes current through the RDA/Tank. Inside the RDA/Tank there is a certain resistance, which differes depending on preference, and it will create vape. So depening on what resistance is in the RDA/Tank, the amount of volts that are pushing through will differ creating either more or less of a vape. More on RDA/Tanks and Batteries will be talked about in the next few pages in more detail.
