# E-Juice

- **Flavors**

E-Juice is probably the most exciting part of vaping for most. There are hundreds of different flavors or all types to choose from which makes vaping inviting for all different types of people. Flavors vary in types and some of which include *Deserts*, *Fruits*, *Coffee's*, *Cereal's*, *Tobacoo's*, *Nut and Spices*, and *Candy's*. Vaping can really be for anyone because of the varieties of flavors there are. Me personally, I like fruits the most and the E-Juice that I vape the most is called Tango Ice which has some Mango in it with a little bit of pineapple and a cool breeze of menthol. I call that my all-day-vape because I can just vape on it all day long and never get tired of it.

- **Sizes**

E-Juice comes in many shapes and size bottles too. They start out at a 15ml bottle. You can also get a 30ml bottle and then if you really like a certain flavor you can get a 120ml bottle. The pricing per bottle for each size varies between different companies and different brands. Usually, a 15ml bottle will go anywhere from $10-14. A 30ml bottle will be aywhere from$16-25. Lastly, a 120ml varies anywhere from $58-85. A 120ml bottle will last quite a while depending on the person and how much you vape a day. 

- **Nicotine Levels**

E-Juice also comes in different nicotine levels. Nictone is the only potential harmful part of vaping compared to cigarettes which have nicotine, tar, tobacco, and many other chemical that you burn into your lungs. If my knowledge serves me right, a cigarette has 1.8% nicotine in each one. E-Juice comes in a 3mg/0.3% nicotine, 6mg/0.6% nicotine, 12mg/1.2% nicotine, and 24mg/2.4% nicotine. All day, every day vapers usually vape on 3mg or 6mg nicotine. 3mg of nicotine in E-Juice is mellow and it can hardly be felt. This is the level of nicotine that people will use generally if they aren't smokers at all. 

- **Quit Smoking**

The general idea of vaping and E-Juice is so that smokers can slowly quit smoking cigarettes. A pack-a-day smoker will most likely start on 24mg or 18mg of nicotine in their E-Juice. After a while, come down a level in nicotine a little and start vaping 6mg. It is a slow process but has worked for many. I vape on 6mg usually and sometimes I will vape on 3mg. Depending on the flavor of the E-Juice, certain nicotine levels will either feel stronger or weaker. If you are not a smoker nor have you ever had a vape, you would start out using 3mg and generally stay there.
