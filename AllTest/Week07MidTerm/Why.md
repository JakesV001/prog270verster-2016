##### [Home Page](/Week07MidTerm/Home.html)

The main reason people vape is to quit smoking - now that is the main reason not the only one - and there are so many benifits to vaping instead of smoking. 

- **Smell**

The **first** reason is the *Smell* of cigarettes compared to that of vaping. The smell of a cigarette hangs on to everything it touches which includes clothes, breath, car interior, pets, and hair. Anyone who is a smoker will tell you that. It smells so bad because when smoking, you are buring tar and chemicals along with tobacco itself. The smell of an E-cigarette/E-cig is not smoke, it is simply vapor that evaporates almost immidiately. Also, E-cigs come with hundreds of different flavors and smells to choose from which brings me to my next point...

- **Cost**

The **second** reason is the cost of cigarettes compares to E-cigs. Take a pack-a-day smoker for example, they will spend anywhere from $300-400 a month on cigarettes, whereas vapng you buy the setup once which is anywhere from $70-250 and then the flavoing/E-juice of course. 

- **Health**

It cannot be said that vaping is helthy for you, but there are many facts stating how bad ciggarettes are for you. Well first of all, cigarettes are an open flame and are one of the highest causes for fires. There are also many health hazards related to smoking cigarettes and a few of them are heart attack, lung cancer, throat cancer etc...

- **Interest/hobby/passion**

So there are some of the negative reasons, in a way, to start vaping, but some possitive reasons to start vaping are the taste of certain E-liquids! There are hundreds of flavors to choose from, you could be a cloud chaser who tries to get the biggest clouds from your vape, and nictone can be calming or relaxing to some. Lastly, vaping can be distracting or something to do.
