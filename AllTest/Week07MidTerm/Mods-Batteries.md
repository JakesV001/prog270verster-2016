# Mods/Batteries

##### [Home Page](/Week07MidTerm/Home.html)

The battery part of the vape is called a "Mod" by most. It basically is just a battery but it is the part of the vape that holds the battery. In most cases, the Mod holds 2 batteries and now some hold three.

The batteries are either 35Amp or 40Amp batteries. With this information, we are one step closer to understanding how Ohms law fits into vaping. 

There are different sizes of the batteries and the size that 99% of people use is the 18650 battery. Most or almost all mods are designed to use an 18650 battery. There is also a 16650 which is shorter and thinner, there is an 18350 and an 18490, but those sizes are almost never used. 

Somewhere on the mod, there is a button of some sort located where ever the manufacturer desides to put it depending on the company. Once the button is pushed, the battery activates, and pushes current through to the RDA/Tank.
