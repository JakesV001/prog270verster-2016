# RDA/Tanks

##### [Home Page](/Week07MidTerm/Home.html)

The RDA or the tank is what screws on the top of the mod. The Tank or RDA is where the current flows through. It is where all the magic happens. There are two types or vapor producing products. There is a tank or an RDA and RDA stands for *Rebuildable Dripper Atomizer*. 

- **Tanks**

A tank holds anywhere from 2.5ml of E-Juice to 5.5ml of E-Juice. So you fill it once and can vape on it for hours without touching your E-Juice bottle again until the tank is finally empty. This is the most convinient way to vape and people who drive for work a lot like this method better. Inside the tank, there is a removable coil. Inside this coil there is wire which has been twisted into a coil. The type of wire this is, is called Kanthal or Ceramic. Inside the coil there is cotton. There are a few types of cotton that is used but for tanks it is usually regular organic cotton. How this works is the E-Juice in the tank, soaks into the cotton which is inside this wire. Once the cotton is soaked, the tank goes on top of the Mod. Then the button is pushed and current flows through the coil. The coil will then heat up, which heats up the E-Liquid which then creates vapor as you suck from the little stem at the top of the tank!

- **RDA(Rebuildable Dripper Atomizer)**

Inside the RDA there are 3 posts with holes in them. At the top of the post there is a screw that screws down and reaches down into the hole. The middle post is the positive post. The two side posts are the negative posts. With the coil and cotton in place, you vape 3-7 times before the cotton is dry of juice, then you drip more juice on the cotton. Then put the drip tip back on, and vape until the cotton is dry again. For an RDA, the best cotton to use is called Japanese Cotton. It is thin slabs of cotton that are really soft and holds E-juice very well. The cost for a little bag of cotton goes for about $2.99.
