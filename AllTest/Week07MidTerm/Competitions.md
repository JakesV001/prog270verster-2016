# Competitions

##### [Home Page](/Week07MidTerm/Home.html)

At vape shops all around, they hold competitions at least once a month. People come in and sign up. There are a few rules on what kind of set ups you are allowed to have inside your RDA. There is a resistance limiter to 0.10ohms. Anything below that, generally speaking, is un-safe anyways because there is so little resistance , that it is almost all the power from the battery pushing directly into the RDA. So there are resistance limters, as well as certain mod limiters. If someone has something out of the ordinary or home-made, it will not be allowed. 

The competition will consist of *two* things, **clouds** and **tricks**. The cloud competition will be based on cloud density and the length of the cloud. Usually two people will stand back-to-back and inhale on 3. 

The trick part of the competition will just give any person around 120-190 seconds to perform as many tricks as they can in that time period. Tricks include blowing an O-ring, jellyfish, throwing O's, splitting O's etc...
