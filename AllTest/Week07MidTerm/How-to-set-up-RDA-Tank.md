# How to set up your RDA and Tank

##### [Home Page](/Week07MidTerm/Home.html)

### **1)** **RDA**

- **Step 1**

Select wire size of choice. Wire size is determined by gauge. They start as thick as 20 gauge and as thin as 32 gauge. The thicker the wire, the smaller the gauge. Thicker wire means less resistance and thinner wire more. The best way to understand this is to think of a hose pipe. The thicker the hose pipe, the more water can flow through, which means less resistance. If the hose pipe is thinner, there is less water flowing through and more pressure/resistance. So I usually use 24 gauge for my RDA builds. 

- **Step 2**

Straighten the wire using a drill. This step is optional, but makes the process much easier when wrapping coils. Place the wire inside the drill and tighten it. Then hold the otherside of the wire with some pliers. Activate the drill for about 5 seconds. The wire should be straight as an arrow at this point.

- **Step 3**

Take a mini screw driver(diameter of your choice) and secure one end of the wire with your left thumb. Then start wrapping the wire around the screw driver as tightly as possible. There should be no gaps between each wrap. Depending on the number of wraps, the resistance will change. Less wraps means less resistance because there is less wire for the current to flow through and vice versa. So if you are looking for a cool, calm vape, use more wrapps. I usually use about 6-10 wraps.

- **Step 4**

Once you have finished wrapping, the coil should end up with 2 leads on each side, facing the same direction. These are the two leads that are going to go through the positive and negative posts in the RDA. 

- **Step 5**

Create another coil (Steps 1-4). RDA's usually have 2 coils in them, one on each side. 

- **Step 6**

With the coil still wrapped around the screw driver, palce the two leads into the negative and positive post holes in the RDA. Once the coild is sitting snug inside the RDA and is nicely centered, tighten the screws at the top of the posts to secure the leads down. Then place the other coil in on the opposite side. 

- **Step 7**

Make sure the screw driver is no longer inside the coil, and fire the mod(Press the button) in pulses. The coils should start to heat up. Depending on the resistance, the coils will either heat up slowly or quickly. The coils will start to get red eventually, and the goal is to get both coils to heat up evenly from the middle, outwards. If they are not, then fire the mod, and squeeze the coil that is heating up too quickly with some pliers. **Warning** - Do not squeeze the coil while still firing the mod! The wire will short out and snap. So heat up the coils till red hot, stop firing, then squeeze. Let them cool down and fire again. Repeat until both coils are even.

- **Step 8**

Allow the coils to cool down completely. Then take some of your Japanese Cotton and cut 2 strips about 5mm wide. With one of the strips, twist one end with your fingers so it is thinner and pointy, and place it inside the coil. Grab the cotton from the other side fo the coil and pull it through. The cotton needs to be even on both sides and as fluffy as possible. Cut each side of the cutton so that they are about 1.2cm long on each side of the coil. Then tuck the cotton under the coil so that each side sits comfortably inside the RDA.

- **Step 9**

Drip some E-Juice on the cotton until fully soaked. Let the cotton soak the juice for a while then drip a little bit more. Once the cotton is ready, place the top cap on top of the RDA where the air holes on the side of the top cap are directly next to or over the coils. The bigger the air holes, the more vape will be produced. 

- **Step 10**

Place the RDA onto the mod and vape!


### **2)** **Tank**

- **Step 1**

Unscrew the coil part of the tank from the glass tank itself. Place the tank upside down because that is where it needs to be filled with E-juice from. 

- **Step 2**

Drip a 2-3 drops of E-juice on the pre built coil itself. This is called priming the coil. It is important when using both an RDA and Tank that the cotton surrounding the coil is well soaked with E-juice, because if it is not, and the mod is fired, the cotton will burn instead of the juice and it will taste bad from then on. So prime well.

- **Step 3**

Fill up the tank with E-juice

- **Step 4**

Screw the coil part of the tank back onto the glass tank, keeping the glass tank upside down to prevent spillage. 

- **Step 5**

Place the tank onto the mod and vape!
